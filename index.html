    <h1>CSC 471 Final Project</h1>
    Sorry this website is super barebones. I am not the best at web development
    and tried to make it so that I could fit multiple images on the same
    (horizontal) line, but it didn't look very pretty, so I just ended up
    putting them all one by one.<br />
    Also, if you don't want to read everything, there is a video walkthrough at
    the bottom of the page.
    <p>
      So, for this project, I focused on creating an ambient cave scene with a
      heavier focus on varying shaders since I really wanted to expand my
      capabilities on that end.
    </p>

    <p>
      You spawn at the edge of the cave without much direction. There's a dense
      fog preventing you from looking too far; this is done by passing a
      collection of uniforms to the fragment shader (fogMinDist, fogMaxDist,
      fogColor) and then calculating the distance a computed fragment is from
      the camera (distance(EPos, vec3(0))) then normalizing that distance
      between fogMinDist and fogMaxDist (clamping to 0 + 1). Then, we mix the
      final computed color (texture, blinnPhong shader, etc) with the fog value
      by that computed normalized distance value. Apart from the fog, there are
      a lot of different objects around; most of these are randomly generated
      around a given point. The mushrooms spawn around five fixed locations
      somewhat circularly, and the roots spawn in a square around the ceiling.
      Sometimes these locations are a bit odd, but most of the time it looks
      pretty good. Also, the walls are all one giant collision object.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you walk a bit forward, you can see a skeleton hanging out next to a
      bunch of crates. What an unfortunate guy. If you don't escape this cave,
      that will be you soon. Better watch out. Also, the crate in front of him
      is selectable. When you hover over it, it gets bright. This is done in the
      fragment shader by calculating the direction of the view vector vs. the
      fragment's normal. In this case, I just wanted the entire box to be lit,
      so every fragment will get a color if a "highlight" boolean is set. The
      CPU decides whether or not to set the highlight boolean by checking if the
      player is within a given distance to the box every frame, and if it is, it
      checks if the player's view direction roughly aligns with the box's
      location. Also, the big crates behind the skeleton all have a collision
      box. The skeleton does not though, nor does the small crate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you continue on your way exploring the cave, you will see this
      collection of odd spikes in the corner. A suspicious key is floating
      behind all of the spikes. You should probably pick up that key. If you
      touch any of these spikes, you will die, and respawn wherever you started.
      You won't lose your keys or anything so it's not a super big deal but I
      wanted to make sure that there were some sort of stakes when you run
      through the spikes to reach the key in the first place. Also, the key has
      a similar highlight when you hover over it to the crate, but this one only
      sets the color if the view dot normal vector value is below a cutoff. That
      gives the effect of highlighting the edges that are not directly facing
      the player (by effectively isolating fragments that are almost
      perpindicular to the player's view direction)
    </p>

    />
    <img width="80%" alt="Key is selectable" src="SelectableKey.png" />
    <p>
      After picking up the key, you might notice a small gold coin on the ground
      in one of the mushroom piles. This coin also spawns randomly between one
      of the five mushroom locations. It doesn't have the selectable highlight,
      because for some reason I couldn't get it to highlight like the keys did,
      but it can still be picked up. It has a skeleton face on it, which kind of
      suggests that you should put it inside the crate in front of the skeleton.
    </p>
    <img width="80%" alt="Coin is on the ground" src="CoinOnGround.png" />
    <p>
      Also, any collectible that you pick up will render on the UI. This is done
      by passing in image textures to the FBO shader, which then renders the
      images on top of the scene view if the position of the UI matches up. It's
      pretty cool in my opinion.
    </p>
    <img width="80%" alt="Coin is now in the box" src="PutCoinInBox.png" />
    <p>
      Upon putting the coin in the crate, the skeleton starts doing a painfully
      long dance that eventually stops as he vanishes from existence. In his
      place is a key that you can pick up.
    </p>

      alt="Skeleton leaves behind a key very mysteriously"
      src="SkeletonLeavesBehindKey.png"
    />
    <p>
      After grabbing the key you can head over to the waterfall with a particle
      system and scrolling texture. This is accomplished by just passing the
      time since the program started into a separate shader thats exclusive
      purpose is to render a scrolling texture. If you walk under the waterfall,
      you can discover an entire new room.
    </p>
    <img width="80%" alt="Waterfall" src="Waterfall.png" />
    <p>
      This final room has a portal frame and a very ominous sign with three
      locks on it.
    </p>
    <img width="80%" alt="Portal room (1)" src="PortalRoom3.png" />
    <img width="80%" alt="Portal room (2)" src="PortalRoom1.png" />
    <p>
      If you walk closer to the locks, you will find that they are all
      selectable. Depending on which one you click, it will get a key placed
      into it. The third key is right at the bottom of the sign because I wasn't
      very creative. By placing it there, I thought I would make it more clear
      that the keys are supposed to go in the locks, but in hindsight... that is
      literally what locks are for, so it really was not necessary.
    </p>
    <img

    />

      width="80%"
      alt="The lock is selectable. (2)"
      src="SelectableLock2.png"
    />
    <p>
      The vines above here are also randomly generated, choosing a random height
      above the previous vine as well as a random rotation. It creates a pretty
      nice effect.
    </p>
    <img width="80%" alt="Spawn location" src="VinesAbove2.png" />
    <p>
      Anyway, after you put in the three keys, the portal opens with another
      scrolling texture, this one moving diagonally. As you walk closer to the
      portal, the screen begins to get more and more purple. This was achieved
      by passing in the distance to the portal every frame to the FBO shader,
      and if all three keys have been collected, the FBO fragment shader does a
      mix between the rendered color on screen and a purple color. This mix is
      applied after calculating UI values, so it would get change the color of
      the on screen keys / coin, but at this point all of the collectibles have
      been used so it doesn't really matter anyway.
    </p>
    <img width="80%" alt="Portal Room (3)" src="PortalRoom2.png" />
    <img
      width="80%"
      alt="Portal turns the screen purple"
      src="PortalTurnsEverythingPurple.png"
    />
    <p>
      After you walk through the portal, it teleports you above the entire cave
      and turns off fog so that you can see how absolutely abysmal the outside
      of this cave looks. As you can see half of the randomly generated roots
      don't make it into the cave, and the skeleton is now hovering in the sky.
      I thought it was kind of funny though, so I kept it.

    <h1>Notes I didn't bring up in the walkthrough</h1>
    <p>
      I worked for awhile on making movement pretty smooth in this game, and so
      the player's active movement is kept track of with a collection of
      velocity values (one for each dimension). Each render frame, before any of
      the objects are drawn, movement for the frame gets calculated in
      tickMovement(), which updates the velocity accordingly. If nothing is
      currently pressed, the velocity slows down until reaching zero. There is
      also gravity and jumping enabled, which is used to reach the key behind
      the spikes. Finally, pressing control causes the player character to
      sprint.<br /><br />
      tickMovement() also detects collisions by passing in the current and
      desired position (the one computed after adding current velocity) to a
      helper function, which iterates over all collision objects and calls
      willCollide(current, desired) on each object. There is a CollisionObject
      interface that I created that all CollisionObjects implement, which just
      made it a little easier to organize objects (The cave wall is a
      CollisionPolygon, which is a collection of CollisionPlanes, but the
      objects in the scene are all CollisionCylinders)

      not):

      Most of the models you download from the above websites will come with
      textures, but if not, I just searched google images to find a texture.
      <br /><br />A lot of those models are not available in OBJ format, but
      most had GLB, so I converted them here:
      <a href="https://convert3d.org/glb-to-obj">GLB to OBJ</a> <br /><br />
      I also had a problem sometimes with rendering .png textures. I used this
      website to convert: <a href="https://png2jpg.com/">PNG to JPG</a> <br />
      <br />
      I also used <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to create some
      of my own models. However, the only object that ended up getting used in
      the final version of the project (of the ones I created) was the cave
      wall.
